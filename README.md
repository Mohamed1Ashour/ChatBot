Chatbot
This is a simple chatbot built using Flask and TensorFlow. The chatbot is trained on a dataset of intents and can respond to user messages with pre-defined responses.

Getting started
To get started with the chatbot, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run the chatbot application using python app.py.
Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000.
Start chatting with the chatbot!
How it works
The chatbot is trained on a dataset of intents, which is stored in the intents.json file. The training data is processed using NLTK and TensorFlow to create a neural network model that can predict the appropriate response for a given user message.

The chatbot application is built using Flask, a Python web framework. When a user sends a message to the chatbot, the message is processed by the neural network model and a response is generated. The response is then sent back to the user through the web interface.

Customizing the chatbot
To customize the chatbot for your own use case, you can modify the intents.json file to include your own intents and responses. You can also modify the neural network model by changing the number of layers or tweaking the training parameters.
